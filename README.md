# Alarm Clock Project

This is a simple web-based alarm clock application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

1. **Live Clock Display:** Displays the current time with seconds, minutes, and hours.

2. **Set Alarm:** Allows users to set alarms by specifying the hour and minute using a user-friendly input.

3. **Alarms List:** Displays a list of all set alarms with the option to delete each alarm.

4. **Styling:** The application features a visually appealing design with gradient backgrounds and stylized text.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

2. Set an alarm by entering the desired time and clicking the "Set Alarm" button.

3. The set alarms will be listed below with a delete button for each.

4. When the alarm time is reached, an alert will be displayed, and the alarm will be removed from the list.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.

- `style.css`: The CSS file with styles for the layout and appearance.

- `script.js`: The JavaScript file handling the clock and alarm logic.

## Styling

The application uses CSS for styling with gradient backgrounds and stylized text.

## Alarm Logic

The alarm logic is implemented using JavaScript, which continuously checks for alarm times. When an alarm time is reached, the alarm is triggered, and the user is notified.
